Hi all,

These are some instructions about GitHub, since all of us are working on our respective 
branches.

I felt the need for this to be added, just to be on the same page and make our lives 
easier by avoiding any potential merge conflicts :)

//To push to current working branch
git add . //adds new changes in all files OR
git add <filename> //adds changes in a specific file
git commit -m “your-commit-message”
git push

//Shift branches
git checkout <branch-name>

//Shift to master
git checkout origin

//take changes from xyz to local-branch
git pull origin <xyz> <local-branch-name>

//To bring a new branch created at remote to your local
git fetch <xyz>

//To merge your branch changes to master - IMPORTANT
git checkout origin master
git pull origin mater <branch-name> // example: git pull origin master kinshuk-branch

//Side note, to merge from master to master if you by any chance work directly
//from a master branch
git pull origin master master

//If you make changes to your current local master and it is either behind/ahead of
//what currently in host/remote master
git stash
